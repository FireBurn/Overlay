Thanks for using this overlay

Most of it's features are now in portage, the x11 overlay or the steam / gamerlay overlays

With the near constant updates to the emul-x86 ebuilds it was proving difficult to keep up and now the bulk of the updates have been completed there's not much point in the Overlay anymore

So long and thanks for all the fish
